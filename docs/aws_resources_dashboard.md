## 🛡️ Security Posture & Vulnerability Scanners

CricScore utilizes a strict DevSecOps pipeline. To view the results of the automated security tools:

### Security & Analysis Dashboards (GitHub Native)

- [**CodeQL & Checkov Alerts**](https://github.com/your-username/cricscore/security/code-scanning): View static application security testing results (e.g., detected SQL injection, XSS) and Terraform misconfigurations (Checkov issues).
- [**Dependabot SCA Alerts**](https://github.com/your-username/cricscore/security/dependabot): View known vulnerabilities in third-party NPM dependencies.

---

### CI/CD Security Scanners (Pipeline Logs)

The following pipelines act as automated gatekeepers. You can view their execution logs and downloadable reports here:

- [**GitLeaks**](https://github.com/your-username/cricscore/actions/workflows/secrets.yml): Detects hardcoded secrets or AWS keys before code is pushed.
- [**CodeQL SAST**](https://github.com/your-username/cricscore/actions/workflows/codeql.yml): Native static application security testing to detect vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
- [**Trivy & Checkov**](https://github.com/your-username/cricscore/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml): Runs inside the unified pipeline to scan dependencies for CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs (Trivy) and audit Terraform misconfigurations (Checkov).
- [**Syft (SBOM)**](https://github.com/your-username/cricscore/actions/workflows/sbom.yml): Automatically generates a Software Bill of Materials (available as a downloadable artifact `spdx-json` on the pipeline run page).
- [**OWASP ZAP (DAST)**](https://github.com/your-username/cricscore/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml): Runs an active baseline scan against the live deployed API Gateway URLs to detect runtime misconfigurations like missing HTTP headers.

### Engineering & Issue Tracking

- [**Open GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/your-username/cricscore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen): View the active queue of pending bugs, requested features, and ongoing tasks. Tracking open issues helps developers understand current system limitations, prioritize upcoming architecture changes, and manage active security remediation efforts.
