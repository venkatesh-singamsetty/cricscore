# [4.0.0] - 2026-09-11

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Cognito SSO Authentication (Breaking Change — replaces PIN-based admin)

- **AWS Cognito User Pool**: Full Cognito-backed authentication for all roles. Replaces `VITE_ADMIN_PIN` system with proper JWT-based identity.
- **Amplify Authenticator UI**: Sign-up/sign-in via `@aws-amplify/ui-react` `<Authenticator>` component with custom `First Name`/`Last Name` fields and field labels.
- **JWT Authorization on all APIs**: API Gateway now uses a Cognito JWT Authorizer. All mutating endpoints (`POST /match`, `DELETE /match/{id}`, `PATCH /match/{id}`, `POST /match/{id}/email`, `POST /innings`) validate the caller's JWT and enforce per-resource ownership.
- **Admin Cognito Group**: The `Admin` Cognito group grants elevated privileges — delete any match, access user management APIs, and purge all data.
- **Cognito Pre-Signup Lambda** (`cognito-presignup`): Auto-confirms guest shadow accounts (`guest-*@cricscore.local`) while enforcing email verification for real users.

### 🎮 Guest Scorer Mode

- **Continue as Guest** button in the Authenticator footer: creates a shadow Cognito account (`guest-{timestamp}@cricscore.local`), signs in immediately, and sets `isGuestScorer = true`.
- **Guest banner**: Shows "GUEST SCORER MODE" strip at top of scorer view with a "Sign In to Save" link.
- **Guest match tracking**: Guest matches are owned by the guest email in the database and can be deleted by the guest or by admins.

### 🛡️ Admin Panel (`AdminPanel.tsx`)

- New **Admin Panel** view accessible only to Cognito `Admin` group members.
- **User Management tab**: Lists all Cognito users with their email, status, and roles. Supports promote/demote to `Admin`/`Scorer` groups and hard-delete from Cognito.
- **Database Cleanup tab**: Exposes admin-only bulk match purge operations.

### 🤖 AI Chat — Delete Guest Users (Admin Only)

- New `deleteGuestData` MCP tool: filters Cognito users whose `email` attribute starts with `guest-` and ends with `@cricscore.local`, deletes them from Cognito, and cascades to remove their match records.
- Only callable when the requesting user is in the Cognito `Admin` group (validated via `isAdmin` in `chatHandler.js`).

### 📧 Match Email — Partnership Summary

- Post-match email report now includes a **Batting Partnerships** section showing wicket-by-wicket run and ball contributions.
- `getPartnerships()` function in `match-api/index.js` computes partnerships from raw ball-by-ball data.

### 💾 S3 Match Backups

- When a match email report is sent (`POST /match/{id}/email`), a JSON snapshot of the full match state is uploaded to the `match-backups` S3 bucket (`backups/match-{id}-{timestamp}.json`).
- Encrypted with SSE-S3 (`AES256`). Public access fully blocked. Cost: $0/month within free tier.

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### UI

- **Sign-in page gap**: Reduced `padding-top` on Amplify authenticator from `1.5rem` to `0.25rem` so the login form appears near the top of the page.
- **Toss screen — BAT/BOWL labels**: Both mobile and desktop toss decision buttons now show `🏏 BAT` and `🟢 BOWL` text alongside the emoji icons.
- **Required Run Rate (RRR) never negative**: Clamped RRR to `Math.max(0, rawRrr)` — when the chasing team has exceeded the target, RRR shows `0.0` instead of a negative number. Also clamped `ballsLeft >= 0`.
- **Stale match screen after login**: A `prevEmailRef` tracks user identity. When a different user logs in (e.g., guest → real account), all match state is cleared, view resets to `VIEWER`, and `hubKey++` forces a fresh `LiveScoreboard` refresh — preventing stale guest match data from bleeding into a new session.
- **Viewer screen — stale live AI summaries**: `summaryHandler.js` now invalidates cached summaries that contain `0/0`, `0 balls`, `currently live`, `yet to begin`, or `has not started` for completed matches.

### Backend Auth

- **Per-resource auth**: `DELETE /match/{id}`, `POST /innings`, `PATCH /match/{id}`, `POST /match/{id}/email` all verify the caller owns the match or is in the Admin group.
- **`DELETE /matches` (bulk purge)**: Now restricted to Admin group only — returns `403 Forbidden` for non-admins.
- **`POST /match` without JWT**: Returns `401 Unauthorized` if `claims.email` is missing.
- **`scorerEmail` enforcement**: Non-admin users cannot override their `scorerEmail` — it is always forced to `claims.email` from the JWT.

---

## 🗄️ Database Migrations

_No new migrations required for this release — all new columns (`scorer_email`, `toss_winner`, `toss_decision`, `ai_summary`) were added in previous versions. Cognito auth is purely application-layer._

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Changes

- **Terraform**: Added `aws_cognito_user_pool`, `aws_cognito_user_pool_client`, `aws_cognito_user_group` (Admin), `aws_cognito_user_pool_domain`, and Cognito pre-signup Lambda trigger resources to `infra/terraform/cognito.tf`.
- **IAM**: New `lambda_cognito_admin` IAM policy granting `cognito-idp:AdminDeleteUser`, `AdminAddUserToGroup`, `AdminRemoveUserFromGroup`, `ListUsers` — attached to the Lambda execution role (`infra/terraform/iam.tf`).
- **API Gateway**: Added new routes for admin user management: `GET /admin/users`, `POST /admin/users/roles`, `DELETE /admin/users/roles`, `DELETE /admin/users` (`infra/terraform/apigateway_http.tf`). All routes use the Cognito JWT Authorizer.
- **S3**: Added `match-backups` S3 bucket with SSE-S3 encryption and public access block (`infra/terraform/s3_backups.tf`).
- **Lambda**: Added `cognito-presignup` Lambda function. Updated `match-api` Lambda with `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` environment variable.

---

## ✅ Testing

- **Backend**: Added 5 new auth/admin test cases to `match-api/index.test.js`:
  - Admin group member can delete any match (regardless of ownership) → 200
  - Non-owner delete attempt → 403
  - `POST /match` without JWT email claim → 401
  - `DELETE /matches` by non-admin → 403
  - `GET /admin/users` by non-admin → 403 with `"Admins only"` message
- **Frontend**: Rewrote `MatchSetup.test.tsx` (4 tests) to handle dual mobile/desktop DOM layout rendering, fixed stale default-overs assertion (20→1), added guest-mode submission test, and added token-authenticated POST test.
- **Total**: 74 passing tests (55 backend + 19 frontend).

---

## 📖 Documentation

- **New** `docs/auth.md`: Full authentication and authorization specification — Cognito flows, guest mode, admin management, JWT validation, cross-session identity guard, infrastructure config, and test coverage table.
- **Updated** `docs/architecture.md`: Security strategy updated to Cognito SSO (removed old PIN-based model), added Admin Panel and cross-session identity guard to component breakdown, added auth role model table.
- **Updated** `docs/cost_management.md`: Added Section 11 (Cognito User Pool — free ≤50K MAUs), updated S3 Storage section with match backups, added Lambda section for cognito-presignup, added Cognito-specific cost optimization tips (guest account purging), updated total cost summary.
- **Updated** `docs/testing.md`: Documented new auth/admin test cases in API Tests section with reference to `auth.md`.

---

# [3.7.1] - 2026-09-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Stale AI Summary Invalidation**: Fixed `summaryHandler.js` cache check to invalidate summaries containing `0/0`, `0 balls`, `currently live`, `yet to begin`, or `has not started` regardless of whether match status is `LIVE` or `COMPLETED`.
- **Score Update Cache Purging**: Added `ai_summary = NULL` to `storage-worker` and `match-api` PostgreSQL UPDATE queries so that any score update or match completion event automatically clears cached AI summaries for fresh generation.
- **Fixture Card Display**: Updated `MatchList.tsx` to render `—` for unstarted team innings (0 overs, 0 balls, 0 runs, 0 wickets) instead of showing `0/0 (0.0)`.

### 💰 Cost Reduction

- **Removed AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK)**: Eliminated ~$2/month in KMS charges by switching all resources to free AWS-managed encryption:
  - **S3** frontend bucket: `aws:kms` → `AES256 (SSE-S3)`
  - **SNS** topic: CMK → `alias/aws/sns` (AWS-managed)
  - **SQS** FIFO queue: CMK → `sqs_managed_sse_enabled = true`
  - Removed `aws_kms_key` + `aws_kms_alias` Terraform resources
  - Removed KMS IAM permissions from Lambda execution role

---

## [3.6.2](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/compare/v3.6.1...v3.6.2) (2026-07-06)

### Bug Fixes

- AI summary race conditions and SQL sorting ([#111](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/issues/111)) ([844c1a2](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/commit/844c1a24d591a4df1b50198af52d1f9e97639456))
- Use scorer_email for E2E email spam filter ([#112](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/issues/112)) ([91cf00d](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/commit/91cf00de12777ac7a3873cd837cf4dd9c6d7905d))

## [3.6.1](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/compare/v3.6.0...v3.6.1) (2026-07-06)

### Bug Fixes

- **ai:** add total_overs to context and scale rulebook policies ([e4d78f4](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/commit/e4d78f4534329041a6bd34f30caa911ff7592919))
- Database migrations and Semantic Release workflow ([#110](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/issues/110)) ([ed2ac0d](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/commit/ed2ac0d320b48805a63c046d231bc1cdc98709b8))

# [3.7.0](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/compare/v3.6.0...v3.7.0) (2026-07-06)

### ✨ Features

- **Admin Match Deletion UI**: Added a dedicated Admin tab with a direct "Delete" (trash) button for matches, replacing the AI-only deletion flow for better usability.
- **Admin Auth Bypass**: If an admin logs in, they are automatically granted Scorer authentication with a default `admin@cricscore.com` email, bypassing the redundant scorer email prompt.
- **View Persistence**: Added `sessionStorage` tracking for the `view` state so that refreshing the page correctly restores the user to the Admin, Viewer, Scorer, or AI Chat tab they were currently on.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **AI Summary Race Condition**: The AI Match Summary occasionally hallucinated the final score because it queried the database before the background SQS queue finished saving the final ball. Fixed by adding a 2.5-second `setTimeout` in the frontend before triggering the `/chat/summary` endpoint.
- **AI Summary Prompt Prefix**: Instructed the LLM to start the summary directly with the toss details instead of prepending filler phrases like "In a completed match".
- **AI Summary Ball Count Discrepancy**: Migrated the match summary ball and over counting logic to rely on the robust `innings` table `overs` and `balls` values rather than manually counting records in the `balls` table.
- **AI Chat Layout Bug**: Prevented the "FINAL SCORECARD" component from rendering underneath and pushing down the AI Chat interface when a match concludes. The Chat component height was also increased to better utilize vertical screen space.
- **AI Database Context Truncation**: Increased the JSON output limit in `executeSql.js` from 2,000 to 25,000 characters, allowing the AI to correctly read and analyze all 10+ historical matches instead of truncating at 4 matches.

---

# [3.6.0](https://github.com/venkatesh-singamsetty/cricscore/compare/v3.5.0...v3.6.0) (2026-07-05)

### ✨ Features

- **Toss Details**: Match setup now captures `Toss Winner` + `Toss Decision` (Bat/Bowl) via dedicated UI controls. Fields are persisted to the `matches` table (`toss_winner`, `toss_decision` columns) and reflected in the AI post-match summary.
- **Admin Login via Chatbot**: The Admin navigation tab has been removed from the public UI. Admins authenticate by typing `/login <pin>` directly into the AI chatbot. On success, `sessionStorage.auth_admin = true` is set and the page reloads in admin mode silently.
- **Delete Match via Chatbot (Admin only)**: A new `delete_match` MCP tool allows admins to delete one, multiple, or all matches just by asking the chatbot naturally (e.g., _"Delete all matches"_ or _"Delete match abc-123"_). Supports single ID, array of IDs, or the special `"ALL"` value.
- **Scorer Email Field**: Match creation now accepts and persists a `scorer_email` for post-match email delivery.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **AI Summary — Incorrect Over Display (0.5 instead of 1 over)**: When a match ended on the 6th ball (completing a full over), the stored overs field would show `0.5` because the over counter hadn't flipped before the match concluded. Fixed by counting actual `ball_events` per innings from the DB at summary generation time, then converting total legal balls to plain English using floor division (6 balls = 1 over, 7 = 1 over and 1 ball, etc.).
- **AI Summary — Decimal Notation (0.5 overs, 1.1 overs)**: The previous `formatOvers` helper passed the raw decimal string to the LLM (e.g., `"0.5 overs (0 completed overs and 5 balls)"`), and the model latched onto the decimal. Replaced with a `ballsToOversText()` function that emits only plain English with zero decimals.
- **AI Summary — Toss Winner Hallucination**: The LLM was inventing or assuming the toss outcome. Fixed by injecting the actual `toss_winner` and `toss_decision` values from the DB directly into the prompt.

### 🗄️ Database Migrations

- `infra/database/migrations/add_toss_fields.sql` — Adds `toss_winner` and `toss_decision` to `matches` (applied to both `dev` and `prod` schemas).
- `infra/database/migrations/add_scorer_email.sql` — Adds `scorer_email` column to `matches`.
- `infra/database/migrations/add_ai_summary.sql` — Adds `ai_summary` column for caching generated summaries.

### ✅ Testing

- Updated `MatchSetup.test.tsx` — Asserts Toss Winner/Decision UI is rendered; verifies `tossWinner`/`tossDecision` in POST payload.
- Updated `match-api/index.test.js` — POST `/match` test includes toss fields and validates new SQL parameter order.
- Updated `summaryHandler.test.js` — Mocks the new `ball_events` COUNT query for all affected test cases.
- Added E2E test: _"Admin - Login via Chatbot and Delete Match"_ — validates `/login` command triggers page reload in admin mode, then verifies chatbot can list matches.
- Updated `user-journey.spec.ts` — Replaced "Who Bats First?" button click with new two-step Toss Winner + Decision selection flow.

### 📚 Documentation

- `docs/ai_architecture.md` — Updated MCP tools list; corrected PDF upload location to chatbot; added new **🔐 Admin Tools & Secret Login** section with full `delete_match` usage guide and toss fields documentation.
- `docs/changelog.md` — This entry.
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` — Added entries 50–52 covering the three AI summary bugs.

## 🚀 v3.1.2: Enterprise Test Coverage & E2E Fortification [2026-06-21]

### ✨ Features & Fixes

- **Playwright E2E Resilience**: Dramatically fortified the end-to-end testing pipeline to properly handle optimistic UI locks. Replaced flawed UI synchronization checks with robust `waitForResponse` network interceptors to guarantee the `/api/live/ball` backend synchronization completes and the frontend lock is released before proceeding with wickets.
- **Deterministic Match State**: Purged hallucinated Playwright steps that were trying to interact with non-existent modals (Toss, Match Settings). The test suite now explicitly and deterministically selects `BATTER_A`, `BATTER_B`, and `BOWLER_A` to ensure test stability regardless of deployment defaults.
- **Comprehensive API Tests**: Integrated comprehensive Vitest backend API testing for the `match-api` module.

---

## 🚀 v3.1.1: Security & Dependency Patch [2026-06-21]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Workflow Runtimes**: Bumped all remaining GitHub Action workflow runners to explicitly enforce Node.js 24.
- **Checkov SARIF Integration**: Integrated Checkov's infrastructure-as-code security scans with GitHub Security, automatically uploading `results.sarif` to the Code Scanning dashboard for unified vulnerability tracking.

---

## 🛠️ v3.0.2: Dashboard Hotfix [2026-06-21]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Regex Extraction**: Corrected the Lambda extraction regex within the automated AWS Resources Dashboard generator script to accurately identify and list deployed AWS Lambda endpoints.

---

- **Semantic Release Clarity**: Updated semantic release documentation to clarify version triggers.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **State Integrity**: Fixed a critical Terraform drift issue where the `ADMIN_EMAIL` repository variable was being silently dropped during CI deployments. Enforced `TF_VAR_ADMIN_EMAIL` passing within the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` pipeline.

---

## 🚀 v3.0.0: The Automation & Security Release [2026-06-21]

This release represents a massive leap forward in the platform's infrastructure, automating the entire CI/CD lifecycle, drastically hardening our security posture, and upgrading our core web frameworks.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

- **React 19 & Vite 6 Upgrade:** The entire frontend application was migrated to Vite 6 and React 19. This required strict null check TypeScript fixes across the component library to support the new type definitions (`App.tsx`, `LiveScoreboard.tsx`, `MatchView.tsx`).

### ✨ Features

- **Enterprise Standards & CI/CD Automation:** Introduced complete automated CI/CD pipelines, semantic release integration, infrastructure drift detection, and full observability standards.
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework:** Added unit testing with Vitest and end-to-end (E2E) testing with Playwright.
- **Pre-commit & Pre-push Hooks:** Added Git hooks to automatically run `gitleaks` (secret scanning) and unit tests before code can be pushed to the repository.

### 🛡️ Security & Infrastructure

- **Supply Chain Auditing (SBOM)**: Integrated Syft into a dedicated `.github/workflows/sbom.yml` pipeline to automatically generate an industry-standard `spdx-json` Software Bill of Materials on every PR and weekly schedule, ensuring total dependency transparency.
- **CI/CD Hardening (Strict Blocking)**: Upgraded GitHub Actions workflows to strictly block AWS deployments if **Trivy** finds fixable HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities (`exit-code: 1`) or if **Checkov** detects undocumented infrastructure misconfigurations (`soft_fail: false`).
- **Security Posture Documentation**: Created a formal Architectural Decision Record (ADR) at `docs/security_posture.md` to explicitly document intentional Free Tier ($0/month) constraints, specifically explaining the deliberate bypasses for AWS WAF, RASP, Checkov infrastructure rules, and aggressive Gitleaks scans.
- **ZAP DAST Scanning:** Configured OWASP ZAP baseline scanner to automate dynamic application security testing against the deployed environment.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Documentation

- **Resolve Pipeline Failures:** Fixed broken dependencies and strict Node 24/20 version enforcement crashes in GitHub actions that were causing pipeline deadlocks.
- **Rapid UI Workflow**: Enhanced `README.md` and `docs/deployment.md` with targeted instructions for bypassing Terraform deployments during pure React frontend development.

## 🔒 v2.8.0: AppSec Pipelines & DAST Automation [2026-06-20]

### Highlights

- **DAST Pipeline Hardening**: Resolved critical GitHub Actions compatibility issues with OWASP ZAP (Node 20 deprecation, v4 artifact API crash, Docker permission denial, and Issue Creation scope).
- **CloudFront Security Headers**: Injected `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Permissions-Policy`, and extended Content-Security-Policy (CSP) via Terraform to natively patch HTTP security warnings from the DAST scan.
- **Server Fingerprint Protection**: Explicitly stripped the AWS `Server` header at the CDN edge to prevent architecture leakage.
- **Action Plugin Modernization**: Upgraded `actions/checkout` directly to `v7` across all workflows to natively support Node 24 runtimes and eliminate legacy deprecation warnings.
- **DAST False Positive Suppression**: Configured a dedicated `.zap/rules.tsv` ignore list and injected `NODE_OPTIONS: "--no-deprecation"` to permanently silence daily automated issues regarding intentionally relaxed React security postures and native punycode warnings.

## 🚀 v2.7.0: Dynamic Badging & CodeQL Completion [2026-06-20]

### Highlights

- **Automated Version Badging**: Replaced hardcoded static README version badges with dynamic `shields.io` GitHub `package.json` parsing.
- **CodeQL Finalization**: Officially resolved and verified all lingering `unused-variable` and `unused-import` CodeQL findings.
- **Repository Polish**: The project is now 100% clean across all GitHub Security vulnerability scanners.

---

## 🛡️ v2.6.0: Security & Compliance Release [2026-06-20]

### CodeQL Security Hardening

- **XSS Mitigation**: Replaced direct `window.location.href` manipulation with secure, encoded fallback URL assignments to prevent DOM-based XSS when parsing the `emailTo` variable.
- **CSRF / SSRF Prevention**: Wrapped all dynamic `matchId` segments in `fetch()` calls with `encodeURIComponent()` to block malicious path traversal.
- **TLS Enforcements**: Removed insecure `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0'` from the backend Lambdas while preserving Aiven DB connectivity, satisfying CodeQL strict SSL verification.
- **Log Forging Protection**: Stripped out raw, unvalidated WebSocket payloads from client console logs to prevent log injection vectors.
- **Code Cleanliness**: Eliminated unused variables flagged by CodeQL static analysis.

---

## 🌍 v2.5.0: Open Source Release Readiness [2026-06-20]

### Public Anonymization & Security

- **Environment Parameterization**: Completely eradicated personal domain names, emails, and AWS infrastructure details from the version-controlled codebase. Replaced hardcoded values with dynamic `.env` injection at both the Frontend and Terraform layers.
- **Open Source Templates**: Introduced mirror `.env.local.example` and `apps/frontend/.env.example` to provide clear, zero-secret setup guidance for external contributors.
- **Documentation Scrubbing**: Cleared `cost_management.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, and `deployment.md` of personal identifiers, replacing them with generic `example.com` placeholders while maintaining instructional integrity.

### Infrastructure Agility

- **Dynamic Pipeline Routing**: Upgraded `infra/scripts/deploy.sh` to seamlessly map local `ADMIN_EMAIL` into Terraform's pipeline, ensuring backward compatibility without exposing secrets.
- **Namespace Standardization**: Unified the entire application under the clean `cricscore` namespace, including migrating legacy cache keys.

## 🚀 v2.4.0: Developer Experience & Infrastructure Unification [2026-06-20]

### Automated Environment Bootstrapping

- **Intelligent Setup Pipeline**: Completely rebuilt `infra/scripts/setup.sh` into an OS-aware (macOS/Linux) installer. It now automatically detects and installs missing mission-critical tools (`node@24`, `terraform`, `aws-cli`, `jq`) using native package managers (`brew`/`apt`).
- **Deprecation Cleanup**: Deleted obsolete scripts (`setup.ps1`, `sync-env.sh`) to reduce maintenance surface area.

### Configuration & Deployment Resilience

- **ALL CAPS Unification**: Enforced a strict, universal ALL CAPS variable convention (e.g., `DOMAIN_NAME`, `TF_DATABASE_URL`) that perfectly aligns local `.env.local` files with GitHub Repository UI standards.
- **Terraform Under-the-Hood**: Upgraded `infra/scripts/deploy.sh` to automatically translate and map these beautiful uppercase variables into the messy lowercase `TF_VAR_` syntax Terraform secretly requires, protecting the developer experience.
- **Non-Destructive Frontend Syncing**: `infra/scripts/deploy.sh` now intelligently _appends_ live AWS API Gateway URLs to `apps/frontend/.env` instead of overwriting the file. This perfectly preserves manual local variables like `VITE_ADMIN_PIN` without requiring redundant entries in `.env.local`.

### CI/CD & Documentation Modernization

- **Dynamic Pipeline Hydration**: Eradicated hardcoded infrastructure parameters (domains, namespaces) from the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file. The CI/CD pipelines now hydrate completely dynamically from GitHub Repository Variables (`vars.DOMAIN_NAME`).
- **Zero-Cost Guarantees**: Updated Cost Management docs to explicitly record the $0-cost architectural optimizations deployed via Terraform (disabling S3 Versioning and DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery).
- **Agnostic Documentation**: Sanitized all architecture, API, and deployment markdown files to permanently remove hardcoded structural version labels (like `v2.0`), significantly reducing future maintenance overhead.

## 🛡️ v2.2.0: Enterprise CI/CD, Security Hardening & Public Release [2026-06-16]

### CI/CD Pipeline Restructuring

- **Consolidated Workflows**: Merged 5 scattered workflow files into 3 component-centric pipelines following enterprise standards:
  - [`ci-cd.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml): Unified pipeline combining Frontend lint, Trivy scan, unit tests, build validation, Backend Lambda dependency check, Terraform format/validate, Checkov IaC audit → parallel deployment to DEV → E2E DEV tests → single manual approval gate → parallel deployment to PROD → E2E PROD tests.
  - [`codeql.yml`](.github/workflows/codeql.yml): Standalone SAST analysis kept separate to avoid delaying fast CI feedback loops.
- **Branch Isolation**: Deploy jobs use `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` — feature branch PRs trigger only validation, never deployment.
- **Concurrency Groups**: `cancel-in-progress: true` on all workflows to prune stale runs and conserve runner minutes.
- **Least-Privilege Permissions**: All jobs scoped to `permissions: contents: read` at workflow level; CodeQL uses `security-events: write` only on the analyze job.

### Security Scanning Integrations

- **Checkov**: Terraform IaC static analysis in `ci-cd.yml` with `soft_fail: true` — flags misconfigurations without blocking pipelines.
- **Trivy**: Filesystem vulnerability scanning (`HIGH,CRITICAL` severity, `ignore-unfixed: true`) in both frontend and backend pipelines.
- **CodeQL**: Native SAST code scanning for JavaScript/TypeScript. Configured to upload results directly to GitHub Code Scanning tab (public repo — no GHAS license required). Runs on push, PRs, and weekly Thursday schedule.
- **Dependabot**: Daily automated dependency updates across `/frontend`, `/apps/backend/lambdas/*`, and `/terraform`.

### Branch Protection Rules (main)

- Enabled native GitHub branch protection on `main` (possible after making repository public):
  - Requires all 3 CI checks to pass: `Lint & Test`, `Backend & Terraform Validation`, `Analyze Code (javascript-typescript)`.
  - Strict mode: branch must be up to date with `main` before merging.
  - Prevents force pushes and branch deletions.
  - No required PR approvals (solo developer — review gate would block all merges).
- `enforce_admins: false` — owner can bypass with `--admin` flag in emergency rollback scenarios.

### Dependency Upgrades (Dependabot)

- React `19.2.6` → `19.2.7` + manually aligned `react-dom` to `19.2.7` (version mismatch caused blank page crash in production).
- `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` → `0.5.3`
- `pg` driver → `8.21.0` (`match-api` and `storage-worker`)
- `@aws-sdk/client-sns` → `3.1069.0` (`score-update`)

### Repository

- Made repository **public** to enable native CodeQL Code Scanning and branch protection rules on the free GitHub tier.

## 🏏 v2.0.2: Timeline Standardization & Cricket Laws Compliance [2026-06-16]

- **Standardized Event Timeline**: Harmonized timeline display across both completed scorecards and live scorers. All special events now display as `<Type>` or `<Type>+<runs>` (e.g., `W`, `W+1`, `Wd`, `Wd+1`, `Nb`, `Nb+2`, `B+1`, `Lb+1`).
- **Bowler Wicket Crediting**: Corrected scoring rules off extra deliveries. Stumpings and Hit Wickets off Wide deliveries are now correctly credited as wickets to the Bowler, whereas other wickets off extras (such as run outs) are not.
- **No-Ball Dismissal Restrictions**: Disabled caught-out options off No-balls in accordance with the Laws of Cricket. Only valid dismissals (such as Run Out) are permitted.
- **API Routing & IAM Permissions**: Resolved email dispatch failures by appending `ses:SendEmail` and `ses:SendRawEmail` actions to the Lambda role and adding missing `DELETE /match/{matchId}` and `POST /match/{matchId}/email` routes to the API Gateway.

## 👥 v2.0.1: Team Sizes, Quotas & Scoreboard Enhancements [2026-06-05]

- **Custom Team Sizes & All-Out Logic**: Added dynamic innings end detection for teams with fewer than 11 players. Innings end automatically when fewer than 2 active batters remain capable of batting, preventing infinite select loops.
- **Bowler Over Quotas**: Enforced over-quotas (`Total Match Overs / 5`) with UI warnings and disabled selects.
- **Maiden Over Detection**: Fixed overs containing Wides or No-balls being counted as maidens.
- **Scorecard Display**: Integrated Hit Wicket display formats and fixed Retired Hurt showing bowler attribution.

## ⚡ v2.0.0: Decoupled Fan-Out Architecture [2026-03-31]

- **AWS SNS Event Hub**: Completely decoupled the `score-update` lambda from synchronous database writes, allowing Scorers to experience sub-100ms UI response times.
- **AWS SQS Reliability Buffer**: Implemented an asynchronous message queue to protect Aiven PostgreSQL from match-day ingestion spikes.
- **Storage Worker**: Provisioned a dedicated serverless worker to handle all ACID-compliant persistence and event scheduling.
- **Universal Broadcaster Hub**: Refactored the WebSocket broadcaster to instantly trigger directly from SNS payloads, bypassing traditional data indexing latency.
- **Infrastructure Integrity Fixes**: Resolved strict Node v24 Aiven TLS rejections (`SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`), fully automated deployment hydration boundaries, and structurally debounced React `useRef` race conditions during high-impact rapid scoring bursts.

---

## 🐛 v1.6.0: Bug Fixes & Data Integrity [2026-04-10]

- **Match Hub Innings Scores**: Fixed scores displaying under the incorrect team when the visiting team batted first.
- **Innings Completion States**: Ensured `is_completed` is set to `TRUE` on innings end and match completion.
- **Winner Persistence**: Persisted `match_winner` to PostgreSQL upon match completion.
- **Email Race Conditions**: Derived final email results directly from the frontend state to ensure accurate "Completed" statuses.
- **Viewer Hub WS Synchronizations**: Added live WebSocket updates when a new 2nd innings starts.
