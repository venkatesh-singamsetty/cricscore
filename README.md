# 🏏 CricScore: Real-Time Cricket Match Engine

🚀 **Production Environment:** **https://cricscore.venkateshsingamsetty.site**

🧪 **Development Environment:** **https://cricscoredev.venkateshsingamsetty.site**

👉 **Deployment Details:** **[Full Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md)**

## 🎯 Project Vision

CricScore demonstrates how a production-style real-time sports platform
can be designed using modern cloud-native, DevOps, security, and
reliability engineering practices while maintaining a cost-optimized
architecture.

The platform simulates a real-world cricket scoring ecosystem:

- Global viewers consuming live match updates
- Authorized scorers submitting ball-by-ball events
- Event-driven processing pipelines
- Infrastructure provisioning using Infrastructure as Code
- Automated security validation
- Observability and operational monitoring
- Fully automated CI/CD workflows

The goal is not only to build a cricket application, but to demonstrate
enterprise engineering practices applied to a real-world workload.

## MCP Tools

The `chat-api` Lambda implements the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** with two registered tools:

| Tool                      | Type            | Purpose                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `execute_sql`             | Text-to-SQL RAG | Writes & executes READ-ONLY SQL to answer live score, player stats, and historical data questions |
| `search_tournament_rules` | Vector RAG      | Embeds the user query and performs cosine-similarity search against the uploaded PDF rulebook     |
| `delete_match`            | Admin Action    | Deletes one, multiple, or all matches from the database (Admin JWT required)                      |
| `deleteGuestData`         | Admin Action    | Finds and deletes all Cognito guest accounts and their match records (Admin JWT required)         |

## Required Environment Variables

| Variable       | Description                          | Example                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `LLM_API_KEY`  | OpenRouter or OpenAI API key         | `sk-or-v1-...`                 |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | LLM provider base URL                | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| `LLM_MODEL`    | _(Optional)_ Override model name     | `gpt-4o-mini`                  |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Aiven PostgreSQL connection string   | `postgres://...`               |
| `DB_SCHEMA`    | Environment schema (`dev` or `prod`) | `dev`                          |

> **Security:** All credentials are loaded inside the MCP Server/tools only. The LLM (OpenRouter) **never** receives `DATABASE_URL` or `LLM_API_KEY` — it only sees tool schemas and query results.

# 🏢 Enterprise-Grade Standards & Technical Documentation

CricScore is engineered to demonstrate production-readiness across 6 core pillars of enterprise architecture. All technical decisions, tradeoffs, and deep-dives are documented in their respective guides below.

### 1. 🛡️ DevSecOps & Security

**Zero-Trust Identity & Automated Scanning**
We enforce a strict security posture using **AWS Cognito JWT-based authentication**, API Gateway JWT Authorizers, and multi-tenant data isolation. The CI/CD pipeline acts as an automated gatekeeper, blocking PRs that fail GitLeaks, Trivy, Checkov, CodeQL, or OWASP ZAP.

- 📖 **[Authentication & Authorization](./docs/auth.md)**: Cognito SSO flows, guest mode, admin user management, JWT validation, and cross-session identity guard.
- 📖 **[Security Posture & Tradeoffs](./docs/security_posture.md)**: Defense in depth strategy, multi-tenant isolation, and encryption layers.
- 📖 **[Branch Protection & Governance](./docs/branch_protection.md)**: Required status checks, CI/CD pipeline blockers, and administrator enforcement.

### 2. 🔭 Observability & Logging

**Total System Visibility**
All Lambda executions stream structured JSON logs to CloudWatch. We employ AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing across API Gateway, SNS, SQS, and Lambda, allowing us to pinpoint latency bottlenecks. Critical failure metrics trigger automated SNS alerts.

- 📖 **[Observability Suite](./docs/observability.md)**: CloudWatch Dashboards, X-Ray Tracing, Sentry Crash Reporting, and Uptime monitors.
- 📖 **[Cost & Performance](./docs/cost_management.md)**: Free-tier monitoring strategy and architecture scale limits.
- 📖 **[AWS Resources Dashboard](./docs/aws_resources_dashboard.md)**: Automatically generated, real-time index of every single deployed AWS resource with deep-links to the console.

### 3. ✅ Rigorous Testing

**Multi-Layer Test Pyramid**
Code is validated at every tier: Unit tests evaluate isolated Lambda functions, API tests validate REST contracts, and Playwright executes E2E User Journey tests against the staging environment.

- 📖 **[Testing Guide](./docs/testing.md)**: Vitest and Playwright test commands, Availability Testing (Chaos/DR), and E2E structures.
- 📖 **[Toolchain & Security Stack](./docs/tools.md)**: Master list of all CI/CD, IaC, and AppSec tools used in the pipeline.

### 4. ♾️ High Availability & Reliability

**Fault-Tolerant Event-Driven Design**
The architecture decouples the frontend from backend persistence using SNS fan-out and SQS queuing. If the database experiences downtime, SQS retains messages and retries automatically via dead-letter queues (DLQs).

- 📖 **[Detailed Architecture](./docs/architecture.md)**: System design, sequence flows, and EDA logic.
- 📖 **[API Guide](./docs/api.md)**: REST & WebSocket contract specifications.
- 📖 **[Aiven Managed Services](./docs/aiven.md)**: PostgreSQL database configuration and keep-alive strategy.
- 📖 **[Node.js Guide](./docs/nodejs_guide.md)**: ESM vs CommonJS standardizations.

### 5. 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Immutable & Reproducible Environments**
100% of the AWS infrastructure is codified in Terraform. Changes are planned, validated for security drift by Checkov, and applied automatically via GitHub Actions, eliminating manual click-ops errors.

- 📖 **[Full Deployment & Infrastructure](./docs/deployment.md)**: Local preview, bootstrap foundations, and AWS/Aiven Setup.
- 📖 **[Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md)**: Setup fixes and identity verification help.

### 6. 🤖 Agentic AI & RAG

**Production-grade AI with MCP Security Boundaries**
The AI Chat system implements the Model Context Protocol to enforce a strict security boundary between the LLM and the database. All tool execution, credential access, and query validation happens inside the MCP Server — entirely hidden from the LLM provider.

- 📖 **[AI Architecture](./docs/ai_architecture.md)**: Full Agentic RAG design, MCP architecture diagram, troubleshooting log (13 documented bugs & fixes), educational AI concepts, and cost breakdown.

### 7. 🚀 CI/CD Automation

**Aggressive Pipeline Governance**
Merge requests to `main` require 8 passing status checks. The deployment pipeline automatically builds the Vite frontend, synchronizes S3 buckets, invalidates CloudFront caches, packages Lambdas, and executes semantic version releases entirely hands-free.

- 📖 **[GitHub Actions Architecture](./docs/github_actions.md)**: CI/CD Directory structure constraints and pipeline organization.
- 📖 **[Automated Releases](./docs/release_process.md)**: Semantic release and Conventional Commit specifications.
- 📖 **[Full Project Log](./docs/changelog.md)**: Release records and development timeline.
